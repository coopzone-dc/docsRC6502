Contains documentation for the RC6502 Apple 1 clone.

These documents are collected together here to help get you started. There are a couple of BASIC/ASM programs as well.

Note: to paste the BASIC programs or ASM code into your RC6502 board, you will need to configure delays. Character delay 2-10ms, 
end of line delay 50-200ms. You probably need to experiment a little to get the best results for you.

It seems that Krusaider ASM needs bit more delay than BASIC, I use Krusaider: Line Delay=100ms, Character Delay=10ms and for
BASIC: Line Delay=100ms, Character Delay=2ms

Have fun
