This is a copy of Enhanced Basic for the RC6502 Apple 1 clone.

It's a MONitor file, and must be pasted into the Apple 1 monitor, I normally set the delays in my
terminal character delay = 2ms and end of line delay = 50ms

Once loaded you run the program 5000 R, and you will be prompted:

6502 EhBASIC [C]old/[W]arm ?

Memory size ? 20480 <--- You must set this or basic will fail to run!
